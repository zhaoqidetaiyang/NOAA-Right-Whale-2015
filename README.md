# NOAA-Right-Whale-2015
I got rank 8 on leaderboard

1.run train.ssd.py to get whale's head box

2.run the_regression.py to regress theta

3.run metric_learning.py to train metric learning

4.run pred_class to get the result

tricks: some whales can not be detected, you can pick the whale by hand to label the box,if you do that you can get higher score.may be you can get 1th.
